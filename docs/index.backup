## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Plan Ahead**: Always check the upgrade requirements for your buildings and plan your resources accordingly. Don't open packs before you are ready to start a building upgrade.
- **Team Up**: Join an active alliance to get help with upgrades, alliance tech and reinforcements.
- **Balance is Key**: Don’t focus on just one type of troop or building. A balanced base is a strong base!
- **Use Boosts**: Speed-ups and resource boosts (like Megan, the Construction Hall and Library) can save you a lot of time and effort.
