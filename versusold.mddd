# Weekly Strategy Guide  

## Day 1 (Monday) – Maximize Early Gains  
For me (reset at 2 a.m. in France), preparation starts **Sunday evening**:  
- Deploy vehicles to harvest resources overnight.  
- Wake up to **1M+ points** (alliance minimum), but aim for **2M** to secure all rewards.  

### Key Actions:  
1. **Research Priority**: Focus on **Wisdom Medal** projects, especially the **Duel tree** (boosts future duel points).  
2. **Accelerators**: Use research/building speed-ups to complete everything started on Monday.  
3. **Long Builds**: End the day by initiating **7+ day projects** to prepare for later in the week.

## Day 2 (Tuesday) – Efficient Routine  
A lighter day with minimal playtime:  

### Basic Routine:  
- Spend energy.  
- Complete radar quests.  
- Collect daily rewards.  

### Goal:  
- Reach **1M points** (or **2M** if possible).  
- For F2P accounts, **1M is acceptable**—prioritize efficiency.  

### Hero Upgrades:  
Use recruitment tickets in this order:  
1. **Blue** heroes → 2. **Purple** → 3. **Yellow** (if needed).  
- **Do NOT waste yellow fragments unnecessarily**.  
- *Tip*: If you hit **1.4M+**, excess points may be wasted. Consult your alliance before using yellows.

## Day 3 (Wednesday) – Push for 2M Points  
Combine tactics for maximum gains:  

### Strategy:  
1. **Open equipment chests**.  
2. **Perform 4 truck runs** (use saved tickets, prioritize **S-tier trucks**).  
3. **Speed up troop production** (focus on **promotions over quantity**—power matters more).  

*Note*: With good resource management, **2M is achievable without stress**.

## Day 4 (Thursday) – Easy but Boring  
Minimal effort, steady rewards:  

### Tasks:  
- Upgrade **vehicles** (quick points).  
- Spam **giant zombies** (time-consuming but high payoff).  
- Complete **saved radar quests** (from Wednesday).  

---  

## Day 5 (Friday) – The Hardest Day  
Requires careful planning:  

### Plan:  
1. **Use Energy Cores** (saved from earlier in the week).  
2. **Spend Golden Hero Shards** (saved for Tuesday’s strategy).  
3. **Optimize long projects**:  
   - Speed up **7+ day research/builds** (started Monday).  
   - *Never finish projects on Friday*—time completions for **Monday reset** to jumpstart next week.  

---  

## Day 6 (Saturday) – War Day  
**All-out domination**:  

### Objectives:  
- Attack enemy troops.  
- Plunder resources.  
- Secure **Server 95 dominance**.  

### Tips:  
- Target **low-defense, high-resource players**.  
- Coordinate with your alliance.  
- **Shield between attacks** if vulnerable.  

*This is your week’s climax—fight hard!*
