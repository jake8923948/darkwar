## Tips
- **Early Game**: Focus on upgrading the City Gate to increase its durability and protect your base from early attacks.
- **Mid Game**: Pair the City Gate with other defensive buildings, like the Watchtower, to create a strong defensive setup.
- **Late Game**: Keep the City Gate at a high level to withstand high-level enemy attacks.
- **Resource Management**: Use speed-up items or resource boosts to reduce upgrade times and costs.
